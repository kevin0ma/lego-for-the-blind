Where have we been for the last 4 years? Here's the scoop: We convinced Lego to write their own text-based instructions for their sets! You can find them on legoaudioinstructions.com. Their terminology is a little different than the instructions on this site, but it is easy to learn and understand. Lego have instructions for 30 sets so far, and will hopefully continue to make more. Lego For The Blind  isn't going anywhere though. I haven't posted instructions in a few years, because Lilya Finkel, who wrote the  text-based instructions, died in 2017. Since then, I've been looking for sighted  volunteers to write text-based instructions.  If you'd like to volunteer, please contact me via the form on this site. I'll be posting instructions less frequently, since these volunteers are doing this in their spare time. I'll be posting text-based instructions for the Fairground mixer, Ferris Wheel, Detective's Office, and Horizon Express soon.  I know that these sets are older, and not available in stores anymore,  (though you can find them on Ebay or BrickLink),  but when Lilya wrote them, they were brand-new sets and I still want people to have access to them. Some users have requested text-based instructions for the Apolo 11 Lunar Lander, Statue Of Liberty, and 24-hour race-car. These instructions are coming at some point, but it may take months, or even a year, to release them. Happy building!
