Finally! I have time to update this thing! I've been running around like crazy applying to colleges, so haven't had time to post updates, but now that time has come. The Palace Cinema, Cole's Dragon, Chopper Transporter, and Detective's Office are now fully-accessible to blind builders. I've also updated the Snap Circuits instructions with a key of abbreviations. In other news Lego For The Blind was featured in Time For Kids! With an article fittingly entitled "Let There Be Legos!" BrainCraft (A psychology/neurology Youtube channel), also made a great documentary about us! Watch it here: http://youtu.be/hVy5E2DZkKM We were also featured in MentalFloss and on Nerdist! That's all for now!
