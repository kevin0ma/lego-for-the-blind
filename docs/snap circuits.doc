S2 = press switch. Sp = speaker. R1 = resistor. RP = photo-resistor. U1 = music unit. U2 = alarm unit. U3 = space war unit. Wc = whistle ship. \par\ql Please note: When placing the battery, please place it so that the connections are to the left. When placing the diode, (d1)  make sure that the positive end is marked somehow, (with a high-dot,  for example) so that your child knows where the positive end is. \par\ql  Project 1. Electric Light and switch. Objective: to show how electricity is turned on or off with a switch.  When you close the slide switch (s1) current flows form the batteries through the lamp and back to the battery through the switch. THe closed switch completes the circuit. In electronics this is  called a closed circuit. When the switch is opened, the current can no longer flow back to the battery, so the lamp goes out. In electronics, this is called an open circuit.  \par\ql 1.  Put part 3 on c2-e2.\par\ql 2. Put l1 at c3-c5. Put b1 at c6-e6. Put s1 at e3-e5.\par\ql 2.  Put part 2 on c2-c3. Put part 2 at c5-c6. Put part 2 at e5-e6. Put part 2 at e2-e3.\par\ql \par\ql Project 2. Direct current, (DC) motor and switch.  Objective: to show how electricity is used to run a Direct Current (dc) Motor. WHen you close the switch S1, current flows form the batteries, through the motor, making it rotate. Place the fan blade on the motor shaft, and close the slide switch, s1. The motor will rotate, forcing the fan blade to move air past the motor. In this project, you changed electrical power into mechanical power. DC motors are used in all the battery-powered equipment, requiring rotary motion, such as a cordless drill, electric toothbrush, and toy trains, that run on batteries, just to name a few. An electric motor is much easier to control then gas or diesel engines. Do the same steps as project one, but  put the motor, on c3-c5 instead of l1.\par\ql \par\ql Project 3. Sound-activated switch. Objective: to show how sound can turn on an electronic device. \par\ql Number 1.  Put part 5 at b2-b6.\par\ql Put b1 at d6-f6. Put part 4 at f2-f5.  Put u1 at d2-d4, e2-e4. Put the speaker next to your snap grid/baseboard. Put one jumper cables onto b5, and onto the speaker. Put the other jumper cable onto e4 and the speaker.  \par\ql 2.  Put wc at b2-d2. Put part 3 at b3-d3.  Put (the s1 (the slide switch)  at b6-d6. Put part 2 at f5-f6. Put part 2 at e2-f2.  WHen you close the slide switch s1, the music may play for a short time, and then stop. After the music has stopped, clap your hands close to the whistle chip, or tap the base with your finger. The music should play again, for a short time, then stop. Blow on the whistle chip, and the music should play. You could connect the speaker using snap wires, instead of the jumper wires. But then the speaker may create enough sound vibrations to reactivate the whistle chip. \par\ql Project 4. Adjusting sound level. Objective: to show how resistance, can lower  the sound from the speaker. \par\ql Number 1.   Put part 5 at b2-b6. Put u1 at d2-d4, e2-e4.  Put part 5 at f2-f5. \par\ql Put sp at c5-e5.\par\ql Put b1 at d6-f6.\par\ql Number 2.  Put wc b2-d2.\par\ql Put part 3, at b3-d3. Put part 2 at e2-f2. Put s1 at b6-d6.\par\ql Put part 2 at e4-e5.  Put part 2 at f5-f6. Put part 1 at c5.\par\ql Number 3. Put r1 c3-c5. When you close the slide switch s1, the music may play for a short time and then stop. After the music has stopped, clap your hands, close to the whistle chip or tap the base with your finger, the music should play again for a short time, then stop. In this project you changed the amount of \par\ql current that goes through the speaker and reduced the sound output of the speaker. Resistors are used throughout electronics to limit the amount of current that flows. \par\ql Project 5. Lamp and fan in series. Objective: To show how a lamp can indicate when a fan is running. \par\ql Number 1 1.  Put l1 at b2-b4.\par\ql Put motor at b2-e2. Put part 2 at f2-f3. Put b1 at d4-f4.\par\ql Number 2.  Put 2 at b2-c2. Put part 2 at e2-f2.  Put s1 at b4-e4.  Put 2 at f3-f4.\par\ql  Put the fan blade on the motor. When you close the slide switch, S1, the fan will spin and the light should turn on. The fan will take a while to start turning due to inertia. Inertia is the property that tries to keep a body at rest from moving and tries to keep a moving object from stopping. The light helps protect the motor from getting the full voltage when the switch is closed. Part of the voltage goes across the light and the rest goes across the motor. Remove and notice how the light gets dimmer when the motor does not have to spin the fan blade. \par\ql \par\ql Project 6. Lamp and fan in parallel. Objective: to show how an indicator light can be connected without effecting the current in the motor. \par\ql Number 1.  Put part 4 at b2-b5.  Put motor at c2-e2. Put part 3 at f2-f4. Put b1 at d5-f5. Put l1 at c3-e3.\par\ql Number 2.  Put part 2 at b2-c2. Put part 2 at b3-c3. Put s1 at b5-d5. Put part 2 at e2-f2. Put part 2 at e3-f3.  Put part 2 at f4-f5. Put the blade on the motor. When you close s1, both the fan and the light should turn on. The fan will take a while to start turning due to inertia. In this connection, the lamp does not change the current to the motor. The motor should start a little faster than in project 5. Remove the fan, and notice how the light does not change in brightness as the motor picks up speed. It has its own path to the battery.  \par\ql \par\ql Project 7. Light-emitting Diode. (Led) Objective: to show how a resistor and LED are wired to emit light. \par\ql Number 1.  Put s1 at b3-b5. Put b1 on c5-e5. Put d1 on f3-f5. Put r1 on c3-e3. \par\ql Number 2.  Put part 2 on b3-c3. Put part 2 on b5-c5. Put part 2 on e5-f5. Put part 2 on e3-f3. When you close the s1, current flows from the batteries through the switch, through the resistor, through the led, and back to the battery. The closed switch completes the circuit. THe resistor limits the current and prevents damage to the LED. NEVER PLACE and LED DIRECTLY ACROSS THE  BATTERY! If no resistor is in the circuit, the battery may push enough current through the LED to damage the semi-conductor that is used to produce the light. Leds, are used in all types of electronic equipment to indicate conditions and pass information to the user of that equipment. Can you think of something that you use everyday that has an LED in it?\par\ql Project 8.  One direction for LED. Objective: to show how electricity can only pass in one direction through the LED.  Build the circuit on project 7, but put the LED in upside-down. WHen you close the S1, current should flow from the batteries, through the resistor and then through the LED. WHen current flows through an LED, it lights up. SInce the led is in backwards, current can not flow. The led is like a check valve that lets current flow in only one direction. In this project, you changed the direction for the current through the LED. an electronic component that needs to be connected in one direction is said to have polarity. Other parts like this will be discussed in future projects. Placing the LED in backwards does not harm it, because the voltage is not large enough to break down this electronic component.\par\ql Project 9. Conduction detector. Objective: to make a circuit that detects the conduction of electricity in different materials. \par\ql Rebuild the circuit from project 7, but leave the on-off switch out. When you place a paper clip across the terminals, current flows from the batteries, through the resistor, through the led, and back to the battery. The paper clip completes the circuit and current flows through the LED. Place your fingers across the terminals, and the LED does not light. Your body is too high of a resistance to allow enough current to flow to light the LED. If the voltage, which is electrical pressure, were higher, current could be pushed through your fingers and the led would light. This detector can be used to see if a material like plastic is a good conductor, or a poor conductor. \par\ql \par\ql Project 10. Space war alarm combo.  Objective: To combine the sounds from the space war, and alarm integrated circuits.  \par\ql Number 1.  Put part u2 at a1-a3 a1-b3. Put sp on a4-c4.  Put l1 on a5-c5.  Put b1 on a6-c6.  Put u3 on c1-c3, d1-d3.  Put part 6 on f1-f6. Put part 1 on d6. \par\ql Number 2.  Put part 2 on a1-a2. Put part 2 on a4-a5. Put part 1 on a6.  Put part 1 on c1. Put part 2 on c3-c4. Put part 2 on b3-c3.  Put s2 on d1-f1 Put part 3 on d2-f2. Put rp on d3-f3.  Put s1 on d6-f6.    \par\ql Number 3. Put part 3 on a1-c1.    Put part 3 at a2-a4.   Put part 2 on a5-a6. Put part 2 on c4-c5.  Put one jumper cable on b1-f1, and the other on c6-d6.  Turn it on, press the switch, (s2) several times, and wave your hand over the photo-resistor, (rp), to hear all the sound combinations. If the sound is too loud, you may replace the speaker, (sp) with the whistle chip, (wc).\par\ql \par\ql \par\ql Project 11. Flying saucer.\par\ql Objective: to make a circuits that launches the fan blade, to simulate a flying saucer. Re-build the circuit from project 2,  but reverse the polarity on the motor, so that the negative on the motor, goes to the positive on the battery. When you close the slide switch, (s1), the motor will slowly increase in speed. When the motor has reached maximum rotation, turn the slide switch, (s1), off. The fan blade should rise and float through the air like a flying saucer. Be careful not to look directly down on the fan blade when it is spinning.  The air is being blown down through the blade, and the motor rotation locks the fan on the shaft. When the motor is turned off, the blade  unlocks from the shaft, and is free to act as a propeller and fly through the air. If speed of rotation is too slow, the fan will remain on the motor shaft, because it does not have enough lift to propel it. The motor will spin faster when both batteries are new.\par\ql Project 12. Decreasing saucer lift.  Objective: to show how voltage affects speed of a fc motor and can decrease the lift of the saucer. Change the circuit in project 11, by adding the lamp, (l1) instead of part 3 on c2-e2. When you place the lamp in series with any electronic device, it will craw less current, because it adds resistance. In this case, the lamp  in series reduces the current through the motor, and that reduces the top speed of the motor. Close the slide switch, (s1), and wait until the fan reaches maximum speed. Open the switch, and observe the difference in the height due to the lamp.  in most cases, it may not even launch. \par\ql \par\ql Project 13. Two-speed fan. Objective: to show how switches can increase or decrease the speed of an electric fan. \par\ql 1.  Put motor on b2-b4. Put s2 on c2-e2. Put part 2 on f2-f3. Put b1 on d4-e4.  Put l1 on c3-e3. \par\ql Number 2.  Put part 2 on b2-c2. Put part 2 on e2-f2. Put part 2 on f3-f4.  Put s1 on b4-d4. Put part 1 on c3. Put part 1 on e3. \par\ql Number 3.  Put part 2 on c2-c3. Put part 2 on e2-e3. When you close the slide switch, s1, current flows from the batteries through the slide switch s1, motor m1, the lamp l1, and back to the battery, b1. When the press switch s2 is closed, the lamp is shorted, and motor speed increases. The principle of removing resistance to increase motor speeds, is only one way of changing the speed of the motor. Commercial fans do not use this method because it would produce heat in the resistor, and fans are used to cool circuits by moving air over them. Commercial fans change the amount of voltage that is applied to the motor  using a transformer, or other electronic device.\par\ql \par\ql Project 14. The fuse.\par\ql Objective To show how a fuse is used to break all current paths back to the voltage source.\par\ql Use the circuit built in project 13. When you close the slide switch s1, current flows from the batteries, through the slide switch s1, the lamp l1, motor m1, and back to the battery. Pretend the part 2, from f3-f4 is a device that will open the circuit if too much current is taken from the battery. When press switch s2 is closed, the light is shorted and motor speed increases due to an increase in current to the motor. While still holding press switch s2 down, remove part 2 f3-f4, (the fuse) and notice how everything stops. Until the fuse is replaced, the open circuit path protects the electronic parts. If fuses did not exist, many parts could get hot and even start fires. Replace part 2, and the circuit should return to normal. Many electronic products in your home have a fuse that will open when too much current is drawn. Can you name some? \par\ql \par\ql \par\ql Project 15. Musical Doorbell. Objective: To show how an integrated circuit can be used as a musical doorbell.\par\ql Number 1.  Part 5 on a1-a5. Part u1 on c1-c3, d1-d3.  Part 4 on e1-e4.  Part b1 on c5-e5. Part sp on b4-d4.\par\ql Number 2.  Part s2 on a1-c1. Part 2 on d1-e1. Part 3 at a2-c2. Part 2 at d3-d4. Part 1 at b4.  Part s1 on a5-c5. Part 2 on e4-e5.  Number 3.\par\ql Part R1 on b2-b4. Each time you press the s2, the song will play again and stop. Even if you let go of the s2, the integrated circuit keeps the song playing until it has reached the end of the song. Musical integrated circuits are used to entertain young children in many of the toys and chairs made to hold infants. If the music is replaced with words, the child can also learn while they are entertained. Because of great advances in miniaturization, many songs are stored in a circuit no bigger than a pinhead.\par\ql \par\ql Project 16. Momentary alarm.\par\ql Objective; Show how integrated circuits can also create loud alarm sounds in case of emergencies.   Build the same circuit as in project 15, but  remove r1, and put s2 on a3-c3. \par\ql  When you close s1, the  music integrated circuit u1 may start playing one song and then stop. The song will be much louder than in the previous project because it is now being used as an alarm. Each time you press s2 after the song stops playing, the song will play again, but only while you hold the button down.\par\ql \par\ql Project 17.  Alarm circuit. Objective: to show how an integrated circuit can be used to make real alarm sounds. Do as above, (project 16), but don't use s2, and replace part u1, with part u2.   When you close s1, the integrated circuit should start sounding a very loud alarm sound. This integrated circuit is designed to sweep through all the frequencies, so even hard of hearing people can be warned by the alarm. If the alarm sound was passed through an amplifier and installed into a police car, it would also serve as a good police siren.\par\ql \par\ql Project 18. Laser gun. Objective: To show how integrated circuits sound can easily be changed to exciting space war sounds.  Same as above, (project 17), but put r1 on d3-d5 and put part 3 on a3-c3.  When you close s1, the integrated circuit should start sounding a very loud laser gun sound. This integrated circuit is designed to produce different sounds that can easily be changed. You can even switch the sound on or off quickly to add sound effects to your games or recordings. \par\ql \par\ql Project 19. Space war.\par\ql Objective To introduce you to the space war integrated circuit and the sounds it can make. \par\ql 1.  Part 5 on a1-a5. Part u3 on c1-c3 d1-d3. Part 4 on f1-f4.

Activate it by flipping the switch or pressing the key, do both several times and in combination. You will hear an exciting range of sounds as if a space war is raging! Like the other integrated circuits, the space war IC, is a superminiaturized electronic circuit that can play a variety of cool sounds stored in it, by using just a few extra components. In movie studios technicians are payed to insert these sounds at the precise instant a gun is fired. Try making your sound occur at the same time as an object hits the floor. It is not as easy as it sounds. \par\ql Project 20. Light switch. \par\ql Objective: To show how light can control a circuit using a photoresistor. Use the circuit from project 19, but replace the slide switch, s1, with the photoresistor, rp. The circuit immedietly makes noise. Try turning it off. If you experiment, then you can see that the only ways to turn it off are to cover the photoresistor, or to turn off the lights in the room, (if the room is dark). Since light is used to turn on the circuit, you might say it is a "Light Switch". The photoresistor contains material that changes its resistance when it is exposed to light. As more light that RP receives, the less resistance it produces.  Parts like this are used in a number of ways that affect our lives. For example, you may have streetlights in your neighborhood that turn on when it starts getting dark, and turn off in the morning.\par\ql Project 21.  Paper space war. Objective; Gives a more dramatic demonstration of using the RP. Use project 20. Find a piece of white paper that has a lot of large black or dark areas on it, and slowly slide it over the RP. You should hear the sound pattern constantly changing, as the white and dark areas of the paper control the light to the photosensitive resistance. You can also try the pattern below or something similar to it. (what pattern? (a pattern similar to the piano keyboard, (white black white black, etc) but the black areas are of uneven widths. \par\ql \par\ql Project 22. Light police siren.

The preceeding circuit probably did not seem too exciting; so replace the diode (d1), with the speaker, (sp). You hear a range of exciting sounds. Clap or talk loudly and the sounds will resume. If you find that the sound does not turn off, then vibrations created by the speaker, may be activating the whistle chip.

Do the same thing with a piece of white paper, but tape it lightly on top of the cardboard. Drawing:  get some thin and thick markers. Spin the paper by pressing and holding Press switch s2 down. Press the marker on the paper to form rings. To make spiral drawings, release press switch S2, and as the motor approaches a slow speed, move the marker from the inside outward, quickly. CHange the colors often, and avoid using too much black to get hypnotic effects. ANother method is to make colorful shapes on the disk, then spin the disk and watch them blend into each other. WHen certain speeds are reached under fluorescent light the strobe principal shown in another project, will product strange effects and backward movement.

Place the fan on the motor and press the press switch again. THe lamp is not as bright now, because it takes more power from the batteries to spin the motor with the fan on it, which leaves less batter power available to light the lamp. If you have weak batteries, the difference in lamp brightness will be more obvious because weaker batteries don't have as much power to supply. THe speaker is being used as a low-value resistance here, to make the above effects more apparent. if you remove it, then the lamp brightness will increase slightly. \par\ql Project 81: 1Pencil alarm.
