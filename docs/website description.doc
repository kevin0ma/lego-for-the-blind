Any new news/updates as well as a facebook like button and a   Twitter sharing button, would appear here. \tab  \par\ql The home page would have links to a page entitled About, Links, Instructions, and Conttact. \par\ql The about page: The about page contains  an article about the origins of text-based instructions, (a love affair with lego shifrin.doc). It would also have an article for sighted people as to how to sort the lego pieces for each step of the instructions into separate ziplocs, (which can be found   at the end of this document.)  \par\ql \par\ql The Links page: The links page  features a link to Lego.com, where the sets can be purchased, as well as to Ebay and Bricklink.com, which are useful for finding older/retired sets, and a link to my Youtube Channel, (shifrin2002).  It also can feature links to some other lego fan sites such as jangbricks.com, brickset.com, brickipedia.com, and just2good's youtube channel.  The instructions page: After each set name, there is a Download instructions, and a more info  link. The download instructions link for each set, leads to a page containing download links for the text-based instructions. For example: If we were to click on the Download link, next to set 10214 Tower Bridge, we would come to a page with download links that would lead to  tower bridge book 1.doc, Tower Bridge book 2.doc, and Tower Bridge book 3.doc. It is important to say on this page that print instructions are not included. It is the sighted parent/teacher/friend's responsibility to have access to the instructions to check the blind builder, and to have a physical copy of the set. Graphical instructions can be downloaded from Lego's website.  I do not sell sets, I simply provide an alternative instruction format. The More info link would bring you to Lego's webpage for that particular set, where you can get a detailed description of what the set contains.\lang3 \par\ql The contact page: The contact page  features my e-mail adress.  \par\ql \par\ql \par\ql \par\ql Sorting a set.\par\ql \par\ql Though the following sorting instructions and tips are pretty obvious to the average sighted person, I'm putting them here, just in case. In most larger sets, the plastic bags with the pieces in them will be numbered. Each bag has sub-bags, e.g Bag 1 has six sub-bags. Take a lot of Tupperware containers or bowls, and dump out all the pieces from bag 1. Then sort them by color. The smallest pieces come in a separate sub-bag of bag 1, so don't mix them with the other pieces. Then take a bunch of Ziploc bags, a permanent marker, Lego's graphical instructions, and the textual instructions, (to make sure that the pieces you are putting into a ziploc are the same inin  graphical and text-based instructions), and then sort the pieces according to Lego's instructions. Take another ziploc and label it Extras. Put all the pieces you end up with at the end of the sorting process into this bag, and  trust me, you'll have some extras, with no idea as to where they came from. Sorting Lego is like taking apart a watch, you'll always end up with extras, but  don't worry, they'll find their place during the building process. \par\ql  \par\ql Next, if the same type of piece comes up in different colors, e.g 1 blue 1x2 amongst grey 1x2s, then put the blue into a separate bag, which you put inside  ziploc 1. Also check with the text-based instructions to make sure you are sorting according to their specifications as well as Lego's. Make sure not to overstuff a ziploc, put 5-20 pieces, per bag; more than that will be unwieldy. If you have 1x1 flat-smooth pieces, in blue, and gree, as well as other pieces which are needed for construction of a step, label one bag, A, and the other bag B, and put them inside of Bag 1. After you've sorted about 20 bags, put them into a large bag, and label it Large Bag 1. It's easier for a blind person to rifle through 20 bags, rather than 50 to find the bag they need. Sometimes the point at which to start a large bag, isn't the same as in Lego's instructions, but that's fine. Continue sorting until all of the pieces have found a ziploc home. Then present the set to your builder and let the building begin! }}
